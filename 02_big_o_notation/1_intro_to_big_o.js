// Intro to Big O Notation
// Who Cares?
    // It’s important to have precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs
    // Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches
    // When your code slows down or crashes, identifying parts of the code that are inefficient can help us find pain points in our applications
    // Less important: it comes in interviews!
    // “Tell me the Big O of this algorithm of this function” or “Tell me the Big O of these three functions”

// Motivate need for Big O Notation
    // What Big O Notation is
        // Comparing code and its performance to other pieces of code
        // How to determine which is “the best” code
    // Simplify Big O Expressions
    // Define “time complexity” and “space complexity”
    // Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms using Big O notation
    // Describe what a logarithm is
