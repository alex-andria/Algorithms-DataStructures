// Simplifying Big O Expressions
    // Constants Don’t Matter
        // O(2n) is basically O(n)
        // O(500) is basically O(1)  - a constant
        // O(13n^2) is basically O*n^2
    // Smaller Terms Don’t Matter
        // O(n+10) is O(n)
        // O(1000 + 50) is O(n)
        // O(n^2 + 5n + 8) is O(n^2) because that is the most effecting math
    // Big O Shorthands
        // Arithmetic operations are constant
        // Variable assignment is constant
        // Accessing elements in an array (by index) or object (by key) is constant
        // In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside the loop
